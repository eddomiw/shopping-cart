## Short Description:

Built using ReactJS, Vite, Vitest, and Tailwindcss, this web app creates a clothing store where users can browse, select items, and easily update their shopping cart. It calculates prices per item, considering quantities and total costs.

## Features:

- Clean UI/UX
- Item selection
- Price and quantity calculations
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile applications

## Technologies Used:

- ReactJS
- Vite
- Vitest
- Tailwindcss

## Learning Outcomes:

- Gained proficiency in React, including a solid understanding of state management using useState and handling side effects with useEffect.
- Successfully implemented data fetching to display clothing items and prices within the application.
- Improved mastery of conditional rendering within React, finding the framework to be more user-friendly for this purpose.
- Acquired skills in using React Router to seamlessly link multiple pages while preserving specific elements across different routes.
- Transitioned from SCSS to Tailwind CSS, appreciating the streamlined utility of Tailwind CSS over manually defining class names for styling.

## Motivation:

- Framework Transition: As a first-time React project developer, the transition to using Tailwind CSS and embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) presented interesting challenges. TDD, in particular, introduced a learning curve. I needed to familiarize myself with the syntax and explore the full potential of tools like Vitest. I was not sure about what and how to test initially, which posed questions about efficiency and necessity, but over time, I realized the value of testing.

- Component Testing: While adapting to React and TDD, I discovered the importance of testing components. It not only ensured code integrity but also helped me identify subtle issues caused by accidental keystrokes or component breaks that might otherwise go unnoticed. Testing became an invaluable aspect of my development workflow.

- Tailwind CSS Efficiency and Built-in Media Queries: My switch from SCSS to Tailwind CSS significantly increased development speed and efficiency. Tailwind CSS eliminated the need for arbitrary class names and separate CSS files, allowing me to apply styles directly to elements. Its built-in media queries streamlined responsiveness, enhancing my project's efficiency. While I recognize the need to remember some Tailwind CSS keywords, I anticipate greater proficiency with practice.
